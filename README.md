# Herbie-Animator
Lightweight SFML tool for 2d animations

### About Herbie-Animator
This simple tool was made to improve creating a 2d sprite animation process. It tracks for changes in tracked directory and displays current animation made of images in this directory (everything in real time, so animator doesn't have to care about loading/refreshing). You can use GIMP/Inkscape/Whatever to create frames, then you can switch to Herbie Animator to check if your is properly animated.

### Features:
* automatic tracking for changes in directories with animation's frames
* can be used with other 2d programs, like GIMP/Inkscape
* lightweight
* portable
* minimalistic design
